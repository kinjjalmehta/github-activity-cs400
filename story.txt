Clutching her Mickey Mouse blanket, eight-year-old Charlie entered the attic, the only place her grandparents had forbidden her to go to. It was a bright Sunday morning outside; rays of sunshine entered through the broken window and illuminated the gloomy room where paint had started chipping off the walls.
