Clutching her Mickey Mouse blanket, eight-year-old Charlie entered the attic, the only place her grandparents had forbidden her to go to. 
It was a bright Sunday morning outside; rays of sunshine entered through the broken window and illuminated the gloomy room where paint had 
started chipping off the walls. She stumbled upon an old, discarded carboard box. Wrapping her blanket tighter around her, she decided to 
rummage through the contents. First thing she found was an emptydiary. Upon closer inspection, she realised that the first couple of pages 
were torn off. Not thinking much of it, Charlie moved on the next object. This time it was an old photoframe which is not suprising considering 
the situation but what's suprising was the people in it. 

Front and center were Charlie's grandparents. However, next to them was the Queen of England herself! Charlie's eyes grew wide. A million
thoughts flooded her mind, but the one that seemed most important was the one asking why the picture was taken. With the photoframe still
held tightly in her grasp, Charlie bounded to the kitchen where her grandmother was baking cookies. Charlie prefaced with an apology, knowing
that the attic was forbidden, and cautiously asked about the contents of the picture. Charlie's grandmother looked at it for a moment as
memories swirled behind her eyes.

In 1940, Charlie's grandfather was in the Royal Air Force fighting World War 2 and stationed at the same base camp that the then Princess and her 
sister served in. He saved them from an exploding mortar shell and lost his leg in the process. After the war, he was given special honors for his 
service and got to meet her as Queen! Grandma spent the rest of her day reminiscing about her life during war time with Charlie.
